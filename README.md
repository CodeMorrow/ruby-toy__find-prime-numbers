## Find the Prime Numbers

Given a positive integer n, return an array of all of the prime numbers in the range 1..n.

Ex: find_prime_numbers(25)
=> 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23

Bonus: 

Make your function account for "bad" input, like floating point numbers, or integers less than or equal to one and write the appropriate tests
