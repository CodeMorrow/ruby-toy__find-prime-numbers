## Find the Prime Numbers

Given a positive integer `n`, return an array of all of the prime numbers in the range `1..n`.

For example:

```
find_prime_numbers(25)
=> 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23
```

You might find it helpful to check out [The Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes), if you want help figuring out how to determine if a number is prime in the first place.

### Bonus: 

Make your function account for "bad" input, like floating point numbers, or integers less than or equal to one and write the appropriate tests.

(This is entirely optional.)
